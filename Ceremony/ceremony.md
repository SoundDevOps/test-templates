# Steps to join Oracles-PoA network

## 1. Obtain initial key

## 2. Exchange initial key for mining, voting key and payout keys

## 3. Create azure account

## 4. Generate SSH keys
SSH keys is a pair of cryptographic keys that will be used to access your virtual machine. Each pair consists of a _public key_ and a _private key_. Both of them will be stored on your current laptop/PC in separate files. Public key will then be copied to the virtual machine and used to verify your identity when you try to access it. As a consequence, the first connection can be made only from your current laptop/PC. While public key may be shared with anybody, you should never share your private key. Later, if need be, you'll be able to create additional key pairs on your other devices and access the virtual machine from them as well.

### Mac OS X
1. Open "Finder", choose Utilities from the "Go" menu.
2. Find the "Terminal.app" in the "Utilities" window.
3. Double-click to open the "Terminal.app".
4. Enter the following command in the terminal window and hit ENTER 
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
![SSH-term](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oraclesorg/test-templates/master/Ceremony/gen_ssh_term.png).

5. You'll be prompted to indicate where to store the keys. Accept the default location by hitting ENTER.
6. Next you'll be prompted for a passphrase (password). You can just hit ENTER to use this keypair without a passphrase, however, it is recommended that you provide a strong passphrase.
7. This completes the SSH keys generation procedure and you should see the confirmation in the terminal window. Do not close Terminal just yet.

### Windows PC

## 5. Virtual machine setup.
This is the final step, on which you will create azure virtual machine from a template by filling in a number of fields with data obtained on previous steps. After virtual machine deployment is complete, it will automatically join the Oracles-PoA network and all corresponding activities (voting, payout) will become available to you.

1. Hold <kbd>cmd âŒ˜</kbd> (on Mac OS X) or <kbd>CTRL</kbd> (on Windows PC) and click on the "Deploy to Azure" button below. This will launch the template wizard in a separate browser tab (alternatively, you can right-click on the button and select "Open in New Tab")
